  <h1>About ...</h1>
  <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>
    40-something-year-old American with degrees in Computer Engineering and
    English Literature. I primarily consider myself a writer, but I've also been
    a teacher, tutor, engineer, clerk, surveyor, proofreader, editor, laborer,
    builder and a cook. I'm good at the creative stuff and problem solving, not
    great at following orders. I like gardening and making things. Currently
    traveling.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't use much social media, but <a

    >.
  </p>
  <h2>My history as a 'developer'</h2>
  <p>
    I made my first website in 2001. I took my first computer science course in
    2003. Since then, I've continued dabbling in programming, learning how to do
    things that interested me. I've gotten pretty good as a generalistâ€”I
    understand how computers work and how programs should be structured. But
    I've never had the regular, day-to-day experience of working at a software
    company. Because I've never had that experience, I never became an expert at
    any one thing. So I do have some weaknesses as a developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>On the other hand</i>... I'm phenomenal at working as part of a team. I
    get along with everyone, can give people honest feedback without hurting
    their feelings, have strong enough technical skills that I can understand
    why a problem should be solved in a particular way, and am an above-average communicator. It's a lot easier for a motivated team player to
    improve their technical skills than for someone with good technicals but
    poor people skills to learn to work well with others.
