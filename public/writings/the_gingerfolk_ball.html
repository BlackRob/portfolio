      <h2>The Gingerfolk Ball</h2>
      <p>
        When midnight comes on New Year’s Eve, <br />
        If you’re happy as a mouse, <br />
        Then something magic happens to <br />
        The cookies in your house.
      </p>
      <p>
        As people yawn, and say goodnight, <br />
        Then shuffle off to bed, <br />
        The party’s just beginning for <br />
        The people gingerbread.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s magic so nobody sees it, <br />
        No one really knows, <br />
        But let me tell you, I imagine <br />
        This is how it goes…
      </p>

        <div class="stanzas">
          <p>
            No human’s there to notice, <br />
            As the little hand hits one, <br />
            A sudden scent of cinnamon: <br />
            The New Year's Ball’s begun!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now all the ginger boys and girls, <br />
            Once baked with love and care, <br />
            Can start to stand and move around, <br />
            ‘Cause no one else is there.

            They stretch and yawn, and smile and laugh, <br />
            And nod and shake hands, too. <br />
            They say, “My name is so-and-so”, <br />
            And ask, “How do you do?”
          </p>

            They straighten up their hair and clothes, <br />
            They curtsy and they bow. <br />
            They ask each other, “Shall we dance?” <br />
            Then teach each other how.
          </p>

            The cookies practice fancy steps, <br />
            They strut and twist and sway. <br />
            They all want to be ready when <br />
            The music starts to play.

      <p>
        At two o’clock the cookies hear <br />
        A single violin, <br />
        Which is the classic signal <br />
        For the dancing to begin.

            Some cookies grab a partner, <br />
            Some start dancing on their own; <br />
            Some other shy ones stand like flowers <br />
            By the wall alone.

            Foxtrot, tango, pas de deux, <br />
            They’re dancing every dance they know, <br />
            Inventing new ones, too.

            The music's getting louder, <br />
            As more instruments join in: <br />
            Accordions and trumpets, <br />
            Tambourine and mandolin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just where the music's coming from, <br />
            Well nobody could say. <br />
            It's just something that happens <br />
            On this special holiday.

            The dance goes on, with lifts and dips, <br />
            With twirls and steps ballet. <br />
            If only you could see it, <br />
            It would take your breath away!
          </p>
          <p>
            They say nobody’s perfect, that <br />
            Each cookie has his faults; <br />
            But everyone looks perfect when <br />
            They dance the ginger waltz.

            At three somebody suddenly <br />
            Shouts out for all to hear, <br />
            The time has come for us to choose <br />
            The Cookie of the Year!
          </p>
          <p>
            The rule to win the crown is simple: <br />
            Do what you do best, <br />
            And try to show the world that you <br />
            Shine brighter than the rest!
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you the fastest, strong or cute? <br />
            Can you tell jokes or sing? <br />
            If you’ve any hidden talent, now’s <br />
            The moment, do your thing!

            Is first to join the fun: <br />

        This is an excerpt. I'm still looking for a publisher. I don't mind
        sharing the whole thing, but it's supposed to be formatted as a picture
        book, and there are still some unfinished drawings. I don't want people
        to read it like this, as one long page, but I'm okay with posting the
        beginning.
