        <h2>The Day-of-the-week Diet</h2>
        <p>
          Lately I've been feeling fat, <br />
          So I invented a special diet: <br />
          It's better than some silly fad; <br />
          Maybe you should try it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since following strict rules is tough, <br />
          It uses something better: <br />
          For every day you just eat stuff <br />
          That starts with the same letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monday morning I began <br />
          With muffins, milk and marmalade; <br />
          Mushrooms, meat, marshmallows and <br />
          A fresh new drink called melon-ade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuesday was a little lean, <br />
          Broke my fast with tea and toast. <br />
          Lunch was a too-ripe tangerine, <br />
          And dinner was a turkey roast.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday though I hit a wall: <br />
          Could barely find a thing to eat <br />
          Waffles, walnuts, that was all, <br />
          Till I remembered bread was wheat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thursday I began to cheat, <br />
          'Cause nothing tasty starts with “th”. <br />
          So thin-crust pizza, thickened cream, <br />
          And a thermos of vermouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friday came, a great relief, <br />
          A feast of fruit, filets of fish, <br />
          Fried potatoes, pho with beef <br />
          Really, any <i>food</i> you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soups and soda, salads, snacking <br />
          Made the weekend fly right by. <br />
          Never felt a thing was lacking, <br />
          Finished up with shoofly-pie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked it, but I must admit, <br />
          I quit before week two. <br />
          There was no day with coffee in it <br />
          —what else was I to do?
