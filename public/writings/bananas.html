        <h2>A Sonnet About Bananas</h2>
        <p>
          Like yellow princes, we’re the noblest fruit,<br />
          Up front and center in the grocer’s display.<br />
          Everyone loves us like pirates love loot, <br />
          Like seaside summers, we’re cheerful and gay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potassium-rich, with practical peels,<br />
          We’re easy to grab and toss in your pack.<br />
          Eat us while driving or in between meals, <br />
          The perfect, natural, hundred-cal’rie snack!
        </p>
        <p>
          We only ask to be eaten quickly, <br />
          Before that villain time can steal our looks.<br />
          Not bad, but unappealingly brown, we<br />
          Are tossed or given to someone who cooks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With spotted peels we face the fate we dread,<br />
          As we are mashed and mixed and baked in bread.
        </p>

        This was my first attempt at writing a traditionally-formatted poem. I
        kind of liked it.
