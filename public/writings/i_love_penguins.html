        <h2>I Love Penguins</h2>
        <p>
          If anybody ever asks,<br />
          In life or on a test, <br />
          About my favorite animal, <br />
          I'll say, "Penguins are the best!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Penguin men are always dressed<br />
          Like they're going to a wedding.<br />
          (Ask one if you get a chance,<br />
          That may be where he's heading!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Penguins are, you must admit,<br />
          By far the kindest bird.<br />
          They never mock the way I talk,<br />
          And never called me "nerd".
        </p>
        <p>
          If you visit a penguin home,<br />
          You're in for such a treat...<br />
          They'll offer you the nicest chair<br />
          And give you fish to eat!
        </p>
        <p>
          When you're near the elevator,<br />
          Penguins always hold the door.<br />
          They help old ladies cross the street,<br />
          And give money to the poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Penguins never cheat at cards,<br />
          Or lie or kick or punch.<br />
          A penguin never stabbed a dude,<br />
          Or stole somebody's lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          No animal is perfect, true:<br />
          Even penguins have their flaws.<br />
          For example their wings are just too short<br />
          To properly give applause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gentoos always talk too loud,<br />
          Adelies are somewhat rude.<br />
          Emperors can get annoying<br />
          With their royal attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rockhoppers and chinstraps<br />
          Never text when they'll be late.<br />
          And Magellanic penguins<br />
          Always love the things you hate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other animals are cool, I guess,<br />
          Like unicorns and bears.<br />
          But when compared to penguins,<br />
          Why, nothing else compares!
        </p>
        <p>
          Bears have fur and deadly claws<br />
          On each and every leg...<br />
          But have you ever seen a bear<br />
          That knew how to lay an egg?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll admit that I've liked unicorns<br />
          Since the day that I was born...<br />
          But I can't take one seriously<br />
          Till he grows a second horn.
        </p>
        <p>
          It isn't really fair at all,<br />
          Comparing penguins to the rest.<br />
          I'll bet even cats and dogs agree<br />
          That penguins are the best!
        </p>

        This poem was written for a class project. I was teaching the class, and
        asked all my students to write something creative to celebrate a holiday
        we invented, "Penguin Day". I felt it was only fair that I write
        something, too.
