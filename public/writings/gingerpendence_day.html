        <h2>Gingerpendence Day</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Sally Stars-for-eyes</h4>
        <p>
          In the sky, in the night <br />
          A single star won’t give much light. <br />
          But, my stars, you’re not alone <br />
          Your twinkle joins the light that shone <br />
          From a million billion more <br />
          That had a chance to shine before. <br />
          When chanced to do as they were meant, <br />
          They set ablaze the firmament. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a chance is what I pray. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this Gingerpendence Day?
        </p>
        <p>
          I see stars shining from afar <br />
          But trapped inside this cookie jar, <br />
          I fear no one will ever see <br />
          The light that shines inside of me. <br />
          My world is small, my world is near, <br />
          I fear my light will disappear. <br />
          If too long my dreams defer, <br />
          ‘Twill be as if I never were. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a chance is what I pray. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this Gingerpendence Day?
        </p>
        <p>
          I dream a wider, wilder world <br />
          Where I can march with flag unfurled. <br />
          March despite the risk and fear <br />
          To do the things I can’t do here. <br />
          Touch a tree, feel the breeze, <br />
          Fall in love, write symphonies. <br />
          To realize my destiny <br />
          (However modest it may be). <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a chance is what I pray. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this Gingerpendence Day?
        </p>
        <p>
          When stars shine in the galaxy, <br />
          Their light spreads to infinity. <br />
          I know long after I am gone, <br />
          My ray of light will travel on, <br />
          It may just be a spark at best, <br />
          But when you add it to the rest, <br />
          Combined our light the path will show <br />
          For future stars who walk below. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a chance is what I pray. <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this Gingerpendence Day? <br />
        </p>

        Important context: this was the poem-within-a-poem from my story, "The
        Gingerfolk Ball". The story was about gingerbread cookies coming to life
        on New Year's Day (AKA Gingerpendence Day), and this poem was written in
        the voice of one of the characters, Sally Stars-for-eyes.
